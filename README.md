## About

GDS2-Score is a framework that enables IC designers to quantify the resiliency of their physical layouts to fabrication-time attacks. GDS2-Score analyzes physical IC layouts, encoded in the GDS2 file format. The tool is designed to be extensible. Namely, GDS2-Score simply provides an environment that enables the programatic analysis (through the computation of *metrics*) of various circuit structures encoded in a GDS2 file. Three example metrics are included in this release (v1.2) of GDS2-Score. These metrics include: 1) Net Blockage, 2) Trigger Space, and 3) Route Distance. Detailed information on each metric is provided below. Additionally the custom metrics can be developed, as additional Python modules, and executed by the GDS2-Score framework. Details on developing and executing custom GDS2-Scores metrics are listed below

GDS2-Score takes as input the following:

\**Graphviz .dot file describing specific nets to be analyzed (this file can be generated by the Nemo tool: https://llcad-github.llan.ll.mit.edu/HSS/nemo)*

The output of the GDS2-Score framework is an ASCII report detailing results of each of the three metrics (net blockage, trigger space, and route distance).

## Compatability
Currently, GDS2-Score (v1.2) only supports physical design files generated by Cadence VLSI layout CAD tools, specifically Cadence Innovus and Virtuoso software suites.  

## Metrics

### 1. Net Blockage

The net blockage metric quantifies the percentage of surface area of security-critical nets (defined in the input Nemo .dot file) that are blocked by surrouding circuit components. Thus, the net blockage metric quantifies how *accessible* a given net is within an IC layout. Nets that are more accessible, i.e. less blocked, are easy targets for fabrication-time attacks. There are three types of net blockage that are calculated for each security-critical net: *same-layer*, *adjacent-layer*, and *overall*. Same-layer net blockage only analyzes the north, south, east, and west faces of a net. Adjacent-layer net blockage only analyzes the top and bottom sides of a net. Lastly, the overall net blockage is a weighted average of the same-layer (\~66%, for 4/6 sides) and adjacent-layer (\~33%, for 2/6 sides) net blockages.

### 2. Trigger Space

The trigger space metric computes a histogram of open 4-connected regions of all sizes on an IC's placement grid (trigger space histogram). The more large 4-connected open placement regions available, the easier it is for an attacker to locate a space to insert hardware Trojan circuit components at fabrication time. A placement site is considered to be *open* if the site is empty, or if it is occupied by a filler cell. Filler cells, or capacitor cells, are inserted into empty spaces during the last phase of layout by VLSI CAD tools. They can be removed by an attacker without altering the functionality or timing characteristics of the victim IC. Hence, these components are ignored by the trigger space metric.

### 3. Route Distance

# Development History

## Update 1.1 - 12/7/17
GDS2-Score has been updated to include two additional example metrics: "trigger space" and "routing_distance". Additionally bugs in the Weiler-Atherton polygon clipping algorithm (implemented in the polygon.py module) were fixed.

## Update 1.2 - 2/13/19
Updated all metrics.

## Cloning the Git Repository
git clone <GDS2-Score Repository URL>

## Running GDS2-Score

1. Edit the input file paths located in the "main" function of the "score.py" script
2. To compute all metrics: python score.py -av 

**Note**: to learn how to pass input files via the command line run "python score.py -h".
