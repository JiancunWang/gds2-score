# GDS2-Score

GDS2-Score is an extensible Python framework designed to grade IC layouts against user-defined metrics. The example metric included in GDS2-Score includes the ability to measure congestion percentages around user-identified nets in a GDSII file. GDS2-Score enables IC designers to automatically identify specific regions of an IC layout with specific characteristics.

GDS2-Score takes as input the following files:
1. GDS2 file describing an IC layout
2. DEF file describing an IC layout
3. technology file(s) used in creating the IC design (in the Library Exchange Format)
4. layer map file (.map) describing layer name to GDS2 layer number mappings
5. Graphviz .dot file describing specific nets to be analyzed (this file can be generated by the Nemo tool: https://github.com/mit-ll/nemo)

The GDS2-Score tool is designed to be extensible. This means that GDS2-Score simply provides an environment that allows one to analyze specific nets in a GDS2 file and calculate various metrics. An example "blockage" metric is provided in the release of this tool. The "blockage" metric for input nets is calculated by invoking the "analyze_critical_net_blockage" function in the "main" function of the Python script "score.py". This metric simply calculates the percentage of the total surface area of the nets, described in the .dot file, that is blocked by other nets or components described in the GDS2 file.
