## About

GDS2-Score is an extensible framework that enables IC designers to quantify the resiliency of their physical layouts to fabrication-time attacks. GDS2-Score analyzes physical IC layouts, encoded in the GDS2 file format. Currently, GDS2-Score only supports physical design files generated by Cadence VLSI layout CAD tools, specifically Cadence Innovus and Virtuoso software suites. Three example metrics are included in this release of GDS2-Score. These metrics include: 1) Net Blockage, 2) Trigger Space, and 3) Route Distance. Detailed information on each metric is provided below.

GDS2-Score takes as input the following:

\**Graphviz .dot file describing specific nets to be analyzed (this file can be generated by the Nemo tool: https://github.com/mit-ll/nemo)*

The GDS2-Score tool is designed to be extensible. This means that GDS2-Score simply provides an environment that allows one to analyze specific nets in a GDS2 file and calculate various metrics. Three example metrics are provided in this release (v1.1). These example metrics include "net blockage", "trigger space" and "routing distance". The "net blockage" metric is computed by invoking the "blockage_metric" function in the "main" function of the Python module "score.py". This metric calculates the percentage of the total surface area of the critical nets (in the .dot file input) that is blocked by other nets or components described in the IC layout. The "trigger space" metric is computed by invoking the "trigger_space_metric" function in the "main" function of the Python module "score.py". This metric calculates a histogram detailing the size and frequencies of open contiguous (4-connected) regions on the device layer placement grid of an IC layout. The "routing distance" metric is computed by invoking the "routing_distance_metric" function in the "main" function of the Python module "score.py". This metric computes Manhattan distance estimates between open spaces on the device layer placement grid and critical nets (in the .dot file input) and compares these estimates to the overall mean net length of the entire IC design.

## Metrics

### Net Blockage
### Trigger Space
### Route Distance

# Development History

## Update 1.1 - 12/7/17
GDS2-Score has been updated to include two additional example metrics: "trigger space" and "routing_distance". Additionally bugs in the Weiler-Atherton polygon clipping algorithm (implemented in the polygon.py module) were fixed.

## Update 1.2 - 2/13/19
Updated all metrics.

## Cloning the Git Repository
git clone <GDS2-Score Repository URL>

## Running GDS2-Score

1. Edit the input file paths located in the "main" function of the "score.py" script
2. To compute all metrics: python score.py -av 

**Note**: to learn how to pass input files via the command line run "python score.py -h".
