# GDS2-Score

GDS2-Score is an extensible Python framework designed to grade IC layouts against user-defined metrics. The example metrics included in GDS2-Score includes the ability to measure congestion percentages around user-identified nets in a GDSII file. GDS2-Score enables IC designers to automatically identify specific regions of an IC layout with specific characteristics.

GDS2-Score takes as input the following files:
1. GDS2 file describing an IC layout
2. DEF file describing an IC layout
3. technology file(s) used in creating the IC design (in the Library Exchange Format)
4. layer map file (.map) describing layer name to GDS2 layer number mappings
5. wire report (.route.rpt) describing wire length statistics from the IC layout (output of layout tool)
6. Graphviz .dot file describing specific nets to be analyzed (this file can be generated by the Nemo tool: https://github.com/mit-ll/nemo)

The GDS2-Score tool is designed to be extensible. This means that GDS2-Score simply provides an environment that allows one to analyze specific nets in a GDS2 file and calculate various metrics. Three example metrics are provided in this release (v1.1). These example metrics include "net blockage", "trigger space" and "routing distance". The "net blockage" metric is computed by invoking the "blockage_metric" function in the "main" function of the Python module "score.py". This metric calculates the percentage of the total surface area of the critical nets (in the .dot file input) that is blocked by other nets or components described in the IC layout. The "trigger space" metric is computed by invoking the "trigger_space_metric" function in the "main" function of the Python module "score.py". This metric calculates a histogram detailing the size and frequencies of open contiguous (4-connected) regions on the device layer placement grid of an IC layout. The "routing distance" metric is computed by invoking the "routing_distance_metric" function in the "main" function of the Python module "score.py". This metric computes Manhattan distance estimates between open spaces on the device layer placement grid and critical nets (in the .dot file input) and compares these estimates to the overall mean net length of the entire IC design.

## Update 1.1
GDS2-Score has been updated to include two additional example metrics: "trigger space" and "routing_distance". Additionally bugs in the Weiler-Atherton polygon clipping algorithm (implemented in the polygon.py module) were fixed.

git clone <GDS2-Score Repository URL>

## Running GDS2-Score

1. Edit the input file paths located in the "main" function of the "score.py" script
2. To compute all metrics: python score.py -av 

**Note**: to learn how to pass input files via the command line run "python score.py -h".
